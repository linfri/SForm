# SForm

SForm is an easy-to-use music submission form (R Shiny app + additional R scripts), which uploads music files to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) along with the form data (artist name, track title, country, and artist's website), downloads the files locally, renames the files according to the form data, transforms the data and generates text files + statistics (frequency tables) based on the data. Intended for music compilation producers and [netlabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlabel) owners collecting single tracks from many different sources.

The text files include artist descriptions, tracklists, and the album description + credits. Supports [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu) (disabled by default). Optimized for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) and specifically for [Kalamine Records](http://kalaminerecords.com) submission process.

Created by Linn Friberg (@linfri), who is studying towards BSc with a major in Statistics at Link√∂ping University.
